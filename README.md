## Alicia Merlino

I'm a motivated and ambitious full-stack developer. I have three years experience working as a pharmacist in Sydney, Australia, where I first realised the power of new technologies. When I moved to London in January 2019, I completed a [Code First Girls](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) course, where I fell in love with coding. My favourite part of software development is the ability to combine creativity and problem solving and the endless learning that comes with it. The opportuntiy to continue learning and growing as a developer is key for me in finding a developer role.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I enjoy working in teams and helping everyone to reach a common goal. At Makers Academy, I was in a team to learn JavaScript and make a Notes taking app. Two of the team members were struggling to understand the new concepts in JavaScript such as the DOM. I suggested we reviewed these concepts with the whole team which was successful because all members of the team felt confident moving forward and didn't fall behind.

#### Problem Solving

When I was working as a Pharmacist I was the sole pharmacist in charge of supplying medication to over 300 patients at local mental health facilities. A problem I faced was ensuring all medication being sent out was checked before delivery, and recorded correctly. To manage this, I implemented a process using an excel checklist with each patient listed by the centre they were attending, their medication list and dosage. Before dispensing, I would cross reference the excel spreadsheet to confirm dosage and record delivery. This was very successful as it added confidence to the previously adhoc process.

#### Commitment

Throughout the 3 months at Makers, I have been determined and committed to learning as much as I can. This has allowed me to pick up React and Node.js during my final project without being taught it during the course. This attitude has helped me in my past experiences as well, especially in sport where I competed in the Australian National Championships and Commonwealth Games Trials in Swimming.
