## Alicia Merlino

I'm a motivated and ambitious full-stack developer. I have three years experience working as a pharmacist in Sydney, Australia, where I first realised the power of new technologies. When I moved to London in January 2019, I completed a Code First Girls course, where I fell in love with coding. What I love is the ability to combine my creativity and problem solving skills and the endless learing that comes with it. The opportuntiy to continue learning and growing as a developer is key for me in finding a developer role.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I enjoy working in teams and helping everyone to reach a common goal. At Makers I was in a team to learn JavaScript and make a Notes taking app. Two of the team members were struggling to understand the new concepts in JavaScript such as the DOM. I suggested we go over these concepts with the whole team. This was successful because all members of the team felt confident moving forward and not getting behind in work.

####Problem Solving

When I was working as a Pharmacist I was the sole pharmacist in charge of supplying medication to over 300 patients at local mental health facilities. A problem I faced was ensuring all medication being sent out was checked before delivery, and maintaining a good record of this. To manage this, I created an excel checklist with each patient listed by the centre they were attending, their medications and strength. Each week when checking, I would tick that each strength was correct and date it, then record these excel files. This was very successful as it added another layer of checking on my part, and also meant if there were any questions from doctors or patients about what was sent out I could confirm from my documentation.

#### Commitment

Throughout the 3 months at Makers, I have been determined and committed to learning as much as I can. This has allowed me to pick up React and Node.js during my final project without being taught it during the course. This attitude has helped me in my past experiences as well, especially in sport where I competed in the Australian National Championships and Commonwealth Games Trials in Swimming.

####Speed of Learning

I am highly motivated which helps me to learn quickly. When working at Blooms the Chemist, after one month of training I was given sole responsibility of the mental health dispensing sector. After 3 months at Makers I have also learnt how to learn, enabling me to learn React and node.js in 2 weeks with no prior experience.
