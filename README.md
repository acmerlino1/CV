## Alicia Merlino

I'm a motivated and ambitious full-stack developer. I have three years experience working as a pharmacist in Sydney, Australia, where I first realised the power of new technologies. When I moved to London in January 2019, I completed a [Code First Girls](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) course, where I fell in love with coding. My favourite part of software development is the ability to combine creativity and problem solving and the endless learning that comes with it. The opportuntiy to continue learning and growing as a developer is key for me in finding a developer role.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I enjoy working in teams and helping everyone to reach a common goal. At Makers Academy, I was in a team to learn JavaScript and make a Notes taking app. Two of the team members were struggling to understand the new concepts in JavaScript such as the DOM. I suggested we reviewed these concepts with the whole team which was successful because all members of the team felt confident moving forward and didn't fall behind.

#### Problem Solving

When I was working as a Pharmacist I was the sole pharmacist in charge of dispensing/packing medication, checking it was correct and organising deliveries for over 300 patients across 5 mental health facilities in Sydney. Managing the logistics was a challenge as there were frequent changes in medication doses at short notice. I implemented a new process to ensure I had a thorough record of who I had already dispensed medication for and whoâ€™s dose had changed. I created an excel spreadsheet which listed each patient, the clinic they were attending, their medications and doses, and whether I had dispensed the medicine for that month. When I was checking that all medication was ready for delivery, I could use this spreadsheet to tick if every patient had their medicines packed and correct, and then double check dose changes right before delivery. This had a huge impact as there had been cases where medicines were delivered without the dose change being made.

#### Commitment

Throughout the 3 months at Makers, I have been determined and committed to learning as much as I can. This has allowed me to pick up React and Node.js during my final project without being taught it during the course. This attitude has helped me in my past experiences as well, especially in sport where I competed in the Australian National Championships and Commonwealth Games Trials in Swimming.
