## Alicia Merlino

I'm a motivated and ambitious full-stack developer. I have 3 years experience Working as a pharmacist in Sydney Australia, where I first realised the power of new technologies. When I moved to London in January 2019, I completed a Code First Girls course, where I fell in love with coding. What I like is the ability to combine my creativity with problem solving and the endless learing that comes with it. The opportuntiy to continue learning and growing as a developer is key for me in finding a developer role.
